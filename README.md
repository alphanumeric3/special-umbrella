# ap-research

Counting certain APs around me using Kismet & its API.

Very simple for now, I just walk around with Kismet and check the API using collect.py. Another
approach is using NetworkManager, grep, uniq and other small tools to build a list. But Kismet offers
more info, like who is connected!

This came from a conversation I had about how many WiFi access points my college has!
